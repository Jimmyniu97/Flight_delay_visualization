## Introduction
The goals of this website are to visualize airline delays and cancellation data from 2009 to 2018 by using visualization tools. Our target users are all of the passengers who are planning to take a flight. No one wants to catch a delay when there is a flight plan, and it sometimes can cause embarrassing consequences when those people who are going to take a long flight have asked someone to pick them up at the destination. It is not only wasting time of the passenger, but also the people doing pick-up. And for those who take a flight for a business trip, a delay could be a critical situation if they were late or even missed an important meeting because of the delay. So, the purpose of our website is to offer a legible view of the airports and airlines so that they could make their travel plans more easily and efficiently, and reduce the chance they catch a delay. 
## Data
The dataset we used for this project is called [airline delay and cancellation data, 2009~2018.](https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018)
