					<p>For bubble map, our intention is to construct bubble-like plots that can reflect the total amount of delays in every city from 2009 to 2018. In this case, travelers can easily identify which city and airport have higher delays since the size of the bubble has a direct ratio with the number of delays. Therefore, travelers will be able to find the estimated delay in the city they live in and which airport they should choose to avoid delays.</p>

					<p>Moving on to our next visualization tool, we constructed two histograms to indicate the relationship between delay count and delay time of different airlines. If a traveler has to attend an important meeting in another city and there are multiple airlines he can choose. In this case, he can decide which airline is better by simply lookup on our histogram and figure out which airline has the lowest delay count and time in the past 10 years.</p>

					<p>Our final visualization tool is scatter plot. We believe that the scatter plot has the advantage of showing a non-linear pattern to the user and the range of data flow, i.e. maximum and minimum value, can be easily determined. In this case, we illustrate a more intuitive view of the relationship between total delay time and total delay number so that they can easily distinguish which airlines have relatively low delay time and number and vice versa. Therefore, it will be a useful tool for them to pick airlines when price are the same.</p></font>
